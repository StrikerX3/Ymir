Games that use illegal VRAM access cycle patterns
=================================================

Street Fighter Zero
Street Fighter Zero 2
Street Fighter Zero 3
Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge
Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire
  Sets up two consecutive accesses for NBG0 vertical cell scroll table during intro videos:
    CYCB1 = FFFFCCFF
  This causes every vertical cell scroll fetch for NBG0 to happen twice; the first value is discarded.

Rayman
  Sets up illegal vertical cell scroll fetch timing for NBG1, causing it to be delayed.

Capcom Generation - Dai-5-shuu Kakutouka-tachi 
  Sets up multiple character pattern read cycles for NBG0 bitmap data in VRAM bank B in the image gallery, causing the
  bottom portion of the image (starting at Y=256) to be shifted left. The game compensates for that in VRAM.
  This is in contrast with Doukyuusei - if, which sets up NBG0 and NBG1 with very similar parameters but sets up one
  pair of CP0s in VRAM A and one pair of CP1s in VRAM B, meaning each NBG reads only one bitmap chunk instead of two
  per cycle.

Battle Arena Toshinden Remix
  Sets up multiple PN accesses for NBG2 in-game to display UI elements.

Shichuu Suimei Pitagraph
  Sets up invalid CP accesses for NBG0 with 2x2 character patterns which causes them to be half-shifted forward.

Lunar - Silver Star Story
Mechanical Violator Hakaider - Last Judgement
Shin Kaitei Gunkan - Koutetsu no Kodoku
  Not exactly illegal, but these games change access cycle patterns mid-frame while playing FMVs.

  In Shin Kaitei Gunkan, the image is drawn in NBG0 shifted up by 8 pixels in RGB 8:8:8 (bitmap) format.
  VRAM banks A and B are not partitioned. The game sets up all 8 timing slots for a bank to either CP0 or SH2 access.

  VRAM access cycle updates occur on these VCNTs:
  - 121: change VRAM Bank A to SH2 access. At this point VDP2 should be reading from VRAM Bank B.
  - 167: change VRAM Bank A to CP0 access and VRAM Bank B to SH2 access. Bitmap accesses are still allowed somehow.
  - 213: change VRAM Bank B to CP0 access.

  MSH2 watchpoints at 25F80010 and 25F80018 for VRAM access cycle updates.
  MSH2 breakpoint at 6000840 for VBlank IN.

  Lunar - Silver Star Story and Mechanical Violator Hakaider - Last Judgement do something very similar.
