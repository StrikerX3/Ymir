VDP1 erase/swap timings
=======================

Relevant VDP1 registers:
  TVMD includes the VBlank erase setting:
    VBE=0 disables VBlank Erase mode. VBE=1 enables it.
    Framebuffer erase can occur during display (VBE=0) or during VBlank (VBE=1).

  FBCR defines erase/swap mode among other things:
    FCM=0 FCT=0 is 1-cycle mode.
    FCM=0 FCT=1 is presumably 1-cycle mode as well.
    FCM=1 FCT=0 is manual erase.
    FCM=1 FCT=1 is manual swap.
    Whenever FBCR is written to, an internal flag is set to indicate that FCM/FCT need to be handled next frame.
    If multiple writes are done to this register in a single frame, only the last value is honored.

  PTM defines VDP1 rendering triggers:
    0 = never
    1 = immediately upon writing this value
    2 = on framebuffer swap

  FCM and FCT are processed at the HBlank of the first active display line:
    If FCM=0, setup erase and perform swap
    If FCM=1 FCT=0 and FBCR was written to before this HBlank, setup erase only
    If FCM=1 FCT=1 and FBCR was written to before this HBlank, perform swap only

  Swap simply flips the draw/display framebuffer selector.
  Erase is cycle-counted and writes one 16-bit value every 8 cycles.
    When done during the display period, it avoids writing to the current scanline or beyond.
    When done during VBlank, no Y coordinate restriction applies.

  VBE=1 is processed at the first HBlank of the VBlank period and lasts until the next VBlank OUT.

Relevant video signal events:
  VBlank IN
    Happens at the start of the first scanline past the display area (aka the first bottom border line)
    Triggers the VBlank IN interrupt on the SCU
      Most games use this to set up FCM, FCT, sometimes VBE and PTM
  VBlank OUT
    Happens at the start of the last scanline (at least in this emulator)
    Triggers the VBlank OUT interrupt on the SCU
      Some games use this to set VBE=0 and manually start VDP1 rendering with PTM=1
      Some games also use this to set FCM=1 FCT=1 to immediately swap framebuffers
  HBlank IN during first line of VBlank IN
    Triggers the HBlank IN interrupt on the SCU (as does HBlank IN on any other line)
    Triggers VDP1 framebuffer erase if VBE=1 (VBlank Erase)
  End of HBlank during VBlank OUT
    Stops VBlank erase if in progress
    Processes FCM and FCT, triggering swap and/or erase depending on their values
